There are two options for testing and running our application. The first is a production method which allows you to run a .jar file (similar to running an executable, 
but with a few more steps) or if you're interested in making any changes to the project: the process of cloning and setting up your environment via Eclipse will be 
included.

Method 1: Running the project with .jar file

The first step is to download the JAR file that is included within this repository. We're going to use a Third-Party Jar Executor in order to run our application. 
Be advised: this is for the Windows Operating System only. In order to download the software needed
to run the .jar file, you will need to copy and paste this link into your browser's URL: https://bitstorm.org/jarx/. Next look on the page displayed
and you will see a "clickable" item read as: "Jarx-1.2-installer.exe (74 kB)." Click on this item and save/download it to your local machine. Then navigate to your 
downloads folder and run this file as administrator; you can leave the default location as it is for installation. Now go to the location where you downloaded your 
JAR file, right click it, mouse over "open with," and click Execute Java JAR-files. Now you'll be able to use the Recipe Book application.
